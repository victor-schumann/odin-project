      <em>A simple yet delicious dish straight from India: a mild curry with tomato-onion-cream based sauce and boneless chicken pieces carefully cooked. Except it is not realsly from India because I butchered the recipe, but I promise it's tasty.</em></p>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Dice everything, separate the ingredients and mix evething in the <em>Seasoning</em> section</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix chicken with whatever you like to marinate it. I like using salt, shoyu (JUST A BIT, STOP SCREAMING), black pepper, lemon. Leave it for around an hour in teh fridge.</li>
        <li>Roast the chicken in small chunks in a frying pan with a lil butter. It's important to avoind putting a lot so it doesn't let too much water out. Our goal is to make it golden as fast as possible and to put it all in a bowl. Use the same pan you're going to make the dish for extra free time when you're cleaning the mess.</li>
        <li>When it's done, put it all back in the frying pan, and (no heat), and put onions in the actual pan to saut√©. When that's done, throw the garlic and the ginger.</li>
        <li>For the love of this dish, <strong>dont let the garlic burn</strong> or the dish will be a lot weirder than it already is. When ready, turn the heat down, throw in a bit, JUST A BIT of the seasoning mix you made, mix for a while and then put in the chicken.</li>
        <li>Add butter, cream, about 50% of what's left of the powder mix, tomato puree and pretty much everything else.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Post Script</h2>
      <p>Now, <strong>very important</strong> side note: if it is too thick, put milk, if it is too liquid, put tomato puree and/or cream. Use the rest of the powder to balance things a bit too. And if you ahve any of it left, don't store it under the sun/light, hide it where it's dark.</p>
